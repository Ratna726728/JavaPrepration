:: || ARRAYS AND STRINGS || ::

::ARRAYS::

An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.

The length of an array is established when the array is created. After creation, its length is fixed.

Arrays contains homogeneous data type data in array container object.

Each item in an array is called an element, and each element is accessed by its numerical index. The numbering begins with 0, to the last element.

For example if any array has length 10 then the first element wil be at 0th index and last element must be on 9th index.

By using the indexes we can easily locate the data from the container object.

There are 2 types of arrays:
1. single dimensional array
2. Multi-dimensional array


SYNTAX to declare an ARRAY: 
1. datatype[] arr;
2. datatype []arr;
3. datatype arr[];


How to instantiate an array:

int[] numbers = new int[3];


FOR-EACH loop for Java Array::

The java for-each loop can prints the array elements one by one. It holds an array 
element in a variable, then executes the body of the loop.

syntax:
for(data_type variable : array){
//body of the loop
}
